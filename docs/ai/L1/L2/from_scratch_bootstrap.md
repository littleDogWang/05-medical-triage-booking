# Scenario Baseline Copy Map

> Read when integrating Clinic Reception & Appointments into another application.

## Baseline Rule

This checkout is the 08-medical-triage-booking scenario derivative of the official Agora Next.js voice quickstart. Read its current source before adapting SDK, token or event behavior. Do not generate a replacement integration from memory.

## Implementation Map

| Need | Source of truth | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup and env | package.json, env.local.example | [Setup](../01_setup.md) |
| Voice lifecycle | components/LandingPage.tsx, components/ConversationComponent.tsx | [Lifecycle](conversation_lifecycle.md) |
| Scenario prompt and fixtures | lib/agent-config.ts and local data | [Public recipe](../../../../RECIPE.md) |
| Agent providers and tools | app/api/invite-agent/route.ts, lib/agent-tools.ts | [Agent configuration](invite_agent_config.md) |
| API and call scope | app/api/scenarios, types/conversation.ts | [Interfaces](../06_interfaces.md) |
| Tokens and renewal | app/api/generate-agora-token/route.ts | [Token model](token_model.md) |
| State and deployment | ARCHITECTURE.md, Dockerfile | [Architecture](../../../../ARCHITECTURE.md) |

## Adaptation Sequence

1. Run the existing scenario using Node.js 22+, pnpm 9.15.9 and the documented .env.local contract.
2. Verify an actual call before declaring speech success; local contracts alone are not runtime evidence.
3. Map token, invite, stop, RTC join, RTM subscription and toolkit events into the target app's existing owners.
4. Preserve StrictMode initialization, hook-owned cleanup, combined token privileges, UID remap and interrupted turns.
5. The browser supplies `requester_id` and `channel_name`; the invite route creates and binds the simulated clinic session when tools are enabled.
6. Start with default conversation: Only public clinic facts, policies, doctors and example appointment times enter the prompt; patient fixtures are excluded. The assistant discusses appointment intent but cannot verify identity, find actual openings or change appointments.
7. Add only requested business tools, preserving their exact call scope and confirmation semantics. All patients, slots and bookings are fictional. The assistant does not diagnose, prescribe, contact a nurse, place an emergency call or create a real medical appointment. Use fictional identity details when trying the demo.
8. Run pnpm run verify and the appropriate separate Docker/live acceptance checks.
