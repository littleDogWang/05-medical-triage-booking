# Clinic Reception & Appointments

Handle clinic questions and a complete simulated appointment conversation.

A receptionist for the fictional Agora Family Clinic in Boston answers practice questions and, with tools enabled, identifies a fictional patient, finds eligible openings, and books, lists, moves or cancels simulated appointments. Emergency meaning takes priority over routine scheduling.

Read the [eight-part recipe](RECIPE.md) for example conversations and business customization. This independent scenario derives its RTC/RTM lifecycle from the official [Agora Next.js quickstart](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-nextjs); its scenario facts and tools live in this repository.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer; pnpm **9.15.9** (`packageManager` in package.json; lockfile format 9).
- Access to this repository and an Agora project with RTC, Signaling and Conversational AI available.
- Browser microphone permission; HTTPS for hosted use.
- Docker with a running engine for container verification. Agora CLI is optional for manual setup and required only for its binding commands.

## Run It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/littleDogWang/08-medical-triage-booking.git
cd 08-medical-triage-booking
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill the two required Agora values in `.env.local`, then run `pnpm run doctor` and `pnpm run dev`. Keep an existing env file instead of overwriting it. With a ready Agora CLI, use `agora quickstart env write . --template nextjs --project <your-project> --json` to write template-aware keys for an existing authorized project. Check `agora version` and `agora doctor --json` first; do not create or change a remote project without authorization.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and choose **Talk to clinic reception**. Confirm two-way audio and both transcript speakers with a real call; local checks cannot establish that result.

## Working From A Clone

Run all commands at this repository root. Install the declared pnpm version before using the frozen lockfile; pnpm 8 cannot consume lockfile format 9. On an existing clone, retain `.env.local` and use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm run doctor`, then `pnpm run dev`.

Use the scenario-specific entry and persistent identity; starting voice requires a user action.

## Environment Variables

The tracked example is [env.local.example](env.local.example); local Next.js loads `.env.local`. Hosted environments provide the same values through the platform's secret store.

| Variable | Required | Owner / exposure | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` | Required | Next.js build and runtime; public | App ID from the selected Agora project; Docker must receive the same value at build and runtime. |
| `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` | Required | Next.js server runtime; secret | Signs RTC/RTM credentials and authenticates managed Agent operations; never a build argument. |
| `TOP_TEN_SCENARIO_TOOL_BASE_URL` | Optional | Next.js server; non-secret | This same app's public HTTPS origin. Omit for default conversation; enabling tools requires actual cloud reachability. |

With no valid public HTTPS tool origin, voice uses default conversation mode. A valid-looking URL does not prove that Agora cloud can reach it. Restart/redeploy after changing env and start a new conversation.

Optional BYOK credentials appear only in the invite route's commented provider blocks. They are not needed by default; enabling a block requires supplying its server-only variables and separately verifying the provider.

## Commands

### Setup

`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, configure `.env.local`, then `pnpm run doctor`.

### Development

`pnpm run dev` starts Next.js with its local API routes. Optional `pnpm run dev:clinic` uses an installed cloudflared binary for a temporary tools-only relay; it is not ordinary startup and does not rewrite env files.

### Quality

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm run doctor` | `node scripts/doctor.mjs` |
| `pnpm run dev` | `next dev --webpack` |
| `pnpm run build` | `next build` |
| `pnpm run start` | `next start` |
| `pnpm run lint` | `eslint .` |
| `pnpm run verify:api` | `node --import tsx scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts` |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `pnpm run verify` | Canonical local/CI checks: `pnpm run doctor`, `pnpm run verify:template`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run verify:api`, `pnpm run verify:scenario`, `pnpm run build` |
| `pnpm run verify:scenario` | `node --import tsx scripts/verify-scenario.ts` |
| `pnpm run dev:clinic` | `node scripts/dev-clinic.mjs` |
| `pnpm run verify:template` | Standard repository paths, identity, documentation links and delivery contracts. |
| `pnpm run verify:docker` | Separate Docker image + startup + scenario-route smoke check (synthetic credentials). |

### CI / Pre-ship

`pnpm run verify` is the canonical local and project-CI entry. It includes every shipped scenario check. Doctor requires a populated local env file; CI uses synthetic credentials and mocked Agora operations. `pnpm run verify:docker` is the separate container check.

## Architecture

A browser joins Agora RTC for audio and RTM for transcript/state/metrics events. Next.js signs short-lived tokens and starts/stops the cloud Agent. Scenario instructions select the actual business behavior.

Local development runs one Next.js process at http://localhost:3000 using `.env.local`. Native production uses `pnpm run build` then `pnpm run start`. Docker runs the same app as non-root UID 1001 on port 3000, without a reverse proxy inside the image. The simulated clinic uses one Node process and process-local sessions that expire after two hours. Restart resets the fixtures; multiple workers do not share appointments. A hosted demo needs a long-lived process, and a production integration needs shared durable state.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for topology, ownership and deployment details.

## What You Get

- Public clinic information and a doctor roster with adult/pediatric and new-patient eligibility.
- Six session-bound tools with offered-slot confirmation and atomic rescheduling.
- Emergency escalation that stops ordinary scheduling without claiming an emergency call or transfer.

**Default mode:** Only public clinic facts, policies, doctors and example appointment times enter the prompt; patient fixtures are excluded. The assistant discusses appointment intent but cannot verify identity, find actual openings or change appointments.

**Tool mode:** Six tools operate on an isolated simulated call. The server creates the clinic session only when a valid public tool origin is configured. No hospital, calendar or EHR account is needed.

**Limits:** All patients, slots and bookings are fictional. The assistant does not diagnose, prescribe, contact a nurse, place an emergency call or create a real medical appointment. Use fictional identity details when trying the demo.

## How It Works

| User step | Assistant / app behavior | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ask about the practice or an appointment | Read public information; in tool mode identify the patient before appointment access. | Policy answers or a call-scoped fictional identity. |
| State date, doctor and time preferences | Search eligible openings, offer at most two and preserve unchanged preferences. | Returned slots in America/New_York, with unsupported preferences explained. |
| Choose or change an appointment | Book, cancel or atomically reschedule after the relevant confirmation. | The exact simulated doctor/date/time from a successful tool response. |

The tools are `read_clinic_information`, `identify_patient`, `find_open_times`, `book_appointment`, `manage_appointment` and `record_emergency_escalation`. Each uses `POST /api/scenarios/08-medical-triage-booking/sessions/{sessionId}/{toolName}` with the call ID fixed by the server. Only a slot from the latest search can be booked. A failed move preserves the original appointment.

The browser supplies `requester_id` and `channel_name`; the invite route creates and binds the simulated clinic session when tools are enabled.

## Repo Map

- `app/api/`: token, invite, stop and scenario HTTP routes.
- `components/`: browser RTC/RTM lifecycle, transcript and scenario presentation.
- `lib/medical-triage-booking/`: repository-local business data and rules.
- `lib/agent-config.ts`, `lib/agent-tools.ts`: prompt and optional tool assembly.
- `types/`: application, Agent configuration and presentation types.
- `docs/scenario/`: business guide, design and acceptance cases.
- `scripts/`: doctor, contracts, scenario checks and delivery verification.
- `docs/ai/`: AI loading card, internal recipe, all eight L1 summaries and L2 deep dives.

## Troubleshooting

- **Wrong pnpm / frozen-lockfile error:** install pnpm 9.15.9; do not regenerate the lockfile with pnpm 8.
- **Doctor fails:** check Node, pnpm and the two populated values in `.env.local`.
- **Agent/transcript fails:** inspect token/invite errors, then RTM login. Preserve `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithRtm`.
- **No business write:** Only public clinic facts, policies, doctors and example appointment times enter the prompt; patient fixtures are excluded. The assistant discusses appointment intent but cannot verify identity, find actual openings or change appointments.
- **Lost result or state:** The simulated clinic uses one Node process and process-local sessions that expire after two hours. Restart resets the fixtures; multiple workers do not share appointments. A hosted demo needs a long-lived process, and a production integration needs shared durable state.
- **Docker has no usable client App ID:** rebuild with the correct public App ID and use that same ID at runtime.

## Deployment

Native hosting runs `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run start` on the documented Node runtime. The simulated clinic uses one Node process and process-local sessions that expire after two hours. Restart resets the fixtures; multiple workers do not share appointments. A hosted demo needs a long-lived process, and a production integration needs shared durable state. Serve the public origin through HTTPS; configure the optional business-tool origin only for a cloud-reachable deployment.

### Docker

```bash
docker build --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID -t 08-medical-triage-booking:local .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local 08-medical-triage-booking:local
```

Replace `YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID` with the public App ID used in `.env.local`. Next.js embeds that identifier in the browser bundle, so changing projects requires rebuilding the image. The App Certificate is supplied only at container runtime. A container restart does not preserve process memory. This image does not add a shared state service.

`pnpm run verify:docker` independently builds the image with synthetic credentials, starts an isolated localhost-bound container, checks the home page and a scenario route, then removes only that container. It does not contact Agora or prove a live voice session.

## Security

Use fictional business data. The sample is not a production authentication, authorization or multi-tenant system. Keep certificates, provider keys, local data and local project bindings out of Git, logs and images. Rotate exposed credentials through the owning service and replace the runtime secret. Report security issues privately to security@agora.io; do not post credentials in an issue.
